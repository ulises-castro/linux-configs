The main purpuse is have a nicer experience on you linux.

#### This repository helps you to configure:

```
git clone https://github.com/ulises-castro/linux-configs.git
```

* Now you have to follow the following instructions bellow.

### Tmux configuration

**We have to clone a tmux pro**

1. Run the following code into your personal folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

2. Did it that, run this:
````bash
# type this in terminal if tmux is already running
$ tmux source ~/.tmux.conf
````

**You must go to a tmux enviroment and then run prefix + I for what tmux plugins will be installed correctly.**
